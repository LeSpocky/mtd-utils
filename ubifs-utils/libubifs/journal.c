/*
 * This file implements UBIFS journal.
 *
 * The journal consists of 2 parts - the log and bud LEBs. The log has fixed
 * length and position, while a bud logical eraseblock is any LEB in the main
 * area. Buds contain file system data - data nodes, inode nodes, etc. The log
 * contains only references to buds and some other stuff like commit
 * start node. The idea is that when we commit the journal, we do
 * not copy the data, the buds just become indexed. Since after the commit the
 * nodes in bud eraseblocks become leaf nodes of the file system index tree, we
 * use term "bud". Analogy is obvious, bud eraseblocks contain nodes which will
 * become leafs in the future.
 *
 * The journal is multi-headed because we want to write data to the journal as
 * optimally as possible. It is nice to have nodes belonging to the same inode
 * in one LEB, so we may write data owned by different inodes to different
 * journal heads, although at present only one data head is used.
 *
 * For recovery reasons, the base head contains all inode nodes, all directory
 * entry nodes and all truncate nodes. This means that the other heads contain
 * only data nodes.
 *
 * Bud LEBs may be half-indexed. For example, if the bud was not full at the
 * time of commit, the bud is retained to continue to be used in the journal,
 * even though the "front" of the LEB is now indexed. In that case, the log
 * reference contains the offset where the bud starts for the purposes of the
 * journal.
 *
 * The journal size has to be limited, because the larger is the journal, the
 * longer it takes to mount UBIFS (scanning the journal) and the more memory it
 * takes (indexing in the TNC).
 *
 * All the journal write operations like 'ubifs_jnl_update()' here, which write
 * multiple UBIFS nodes to the journal at one go, are atomic with respect to
 * unclean reboots. Should the unclean reboot happen, the recovery code drops
 * all the nodes.
