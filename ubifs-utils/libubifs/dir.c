/*
 * This file implements directory operations.
 *
 * All FS operations in this file allocate budget before writing anything to the
 * media. If they fail to allocate it, the error is returned. The only
 * exceptions are 'ubifs_unlink()' and 'ubifs_rmdir()' which keep working even
 * if they unable to allocate the budget, because deletion %-ENOSPC failure is
 * not what users are usually ready to get. UBIFS budgeting subsystem has some
 * space reserved for these purposes.
 *
 * All operations in this file write all inodes which they change straight
 * away, instead of marking them dirty. For example, 'ubifs_link()' changes
 * @i_size of the parent inode and writes the parent inode together with the
 * target inode. This was done to simplify file-system recovery which would
 * otherwise be very difficult to do. The only exception is rename which marks
 * the re-named inode dirty (because its @i_ctime is updated) but does not
 * write it, but just marks it as dirty.
